In accordance with Good Industry Practice and Applicable Privacy Laws,  each party shall \nimplement appropriate technical and organisational security measures (including maintaining any security \ncontrols) to ensure a level of security for Personal Data in such party’s possession or control that is \nappropriate to the risk presented by the Processing, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of \nimplemen tation and the nature, scope, context and purpose of Processing as well as the risk of varying \nlikelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects. In assessing the appropriate level of \nsecurity account shall be taken in particular of the risks that are presented by Processing, in particular from \naccidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to Client Personal \nData transmitted, stored  or otherwise  Processed.  \nWithout prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the minimum technical and organisational security \nmeasures that FCM shall implement and maintain are set out in the Annexure to this Data Privacy \nAddendum. FCM may, from time to time, implement adequate alternative technical and organisat ional \nmeasures provided, however, that such measures shall not materially fall short of the level of security set \nout herein.  \n9. Requirements as to personnel.  FCM shall ensure that all personnel involved in the Processing of Client \nPersonal Data are properly  qualified and trained and have committed themselves to keep Client Personal \nData confidential or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality in accordance with \nApplicable Privacy Laws.  \n10. Appointment of data privacy personnel.  Where requ ired, each party will appoint authorised data privacy \nand security contact personnel.  \n11. Appointment of Processors.

FCM shall remain responsible to the Client for any breach of this Data Privacy \nAddendum that is caused by an act, error or omiss ion of the Processor.  \nNotwithstanding the above, Client acknowledges that the Vendors to whom FCM discloses Client Personal \nData in order to provide the Services are independent Controllers under Applicable Privacy Laws, and not \nProcessors. As such, the re quirements concerning Processors described in the preceding paragraph do not \napply to FCM's disclosure of Client Personal Data to Vendors.  \n12. Restricted transfers from the EEA. In order to enable the efficient and effective delivery of its Services, \nFCM may f rom time to time transfer and Process Client Personal Data from the European Economic Area \n(and the United Kingdom) to other jurisdictions. This shall be permitted only where: (i) the transfer is \nnecessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract co ncluded in the interest of the traveller (for \nexample, to book travel or accommodation through a Vendor in a non -European country) or where the \ntransfer is required by applicable law; or (ii) FCM has done all such acts and things as are necessary to \nensure  that any Client Personal Data transferred outside of the European Economic Area (and the United \nKingdom) (whether to an FCM Affiliate, a Processor, or otherwise) will remain adequately protected in \naccordance with the requirements of Applicable Privacy La ws. Client acknowledges that FCM may ensure \nsuch adequate protection by executing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”)  \n(or such other clauses as may be approved from time to time with regard to transfers of Personal Data out \nof the United Kingdom ). Further, if it is anticipated that there will be transfers of Client Personal Data from \nClient in the EEA to FCM, then SCCs wi ll be attached hereto as Annexure 2 and shall apply to such \ntransfers.  \n13. Return of data. The Client may in its absolute discretion by written notice require FCM to return a \ncomplete copy of all Client Personal Data to the Client (or its nominee) by secure f ile transfer in such \nformat as is reasonably notified by the Client. The Client shall be responsible for providing Data Subjects \nwith any notice required under Applicable Privacy Laws in relation to such request.  \n14. Data retention.  FCM acknowledges that, as a general rule, Personal Data may not be kept indefinitely or \nlonger than necessary for the intended Processing. Client Personal Data may only be retained for so long \nas is necessary to satisfy all applicable lawful bases for Processing set out in Art.6 GD PR, where applicable, \nand otherwise for such period as required by Applicable Privacy Laws, and always provided that FCM 5 \n \nC2 - Inter nal Natixis  shall ensure that such retained Personal Data is (i) kept confidential and protected against unauthorised \naccess, disclosure or use and  (ii) only Processed as necessary for the purpose specified in the Applicable \nPrivacy Laws permitting its storage and other Processing and for no other purpose.  \n15. Client’s right to audit. FCM  shall keep or cause to be kept such information as is reasonably necessary \nto demonstrate compliance with its obligations under this Data Privacy Addendum and shall, upon \nreasonable notice during the term of the Agreement, make available to the Client information necessary to \ndemonstrate compliance with its obligations under this Data Privacy Addendum  where such information \nis not subject to confidentiality restrictions owed to third parties. Without limiting the foregoing, FCM \nshall make available to the Client, on request: (i) a list of all Processors appointed by FCM to Process \nClient Personal Data; (ii) a copy of its most recent PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance, to the extent the \nClient Personal Data includes any payment cardholder data;  and (iii) a summary of the results of FCM’s \nlatest internal data security audit for systems that are used to Process Client Personal Data. Any non -public \ndocumentation and information disclosed to the Client in accordance with this paragraph shall be deemed \nproprietary and confidential information of FCM. The Client shall not disclose  such documentation or \ninformation to any third party or use it for any purpose other than evaluating FCM’s compliance with this \nData Privacy Addendum.  \n16. Survival . The undertakings in this Data Privacy Addendum shall remain in force even after termination or  \nexpiration of the Agreement.  \n \n  6 \n \nC2 - Inter nal Natixis  Annexure to Data Privacy Addendum: FCM’s Technical and Organisational Measures  \n \n1. DATA S ECURITY GOVERNANCE  \nFCM  maintains internal organisational and governance procedures to appropriately manage information \nthroughout its lifecycle. FCM  regularly tests, assesses and evaluates the effectiveness of its technical and \norganisational measures . \n2. PHYSICAL ACCESS CONTROL  \nFCM uses a variety of measures appropriate to the function of the location to prevent unauthorised access \nto the physical premises where Personal Data are Processed. Those measures include:  \n• Centralised key and code management, card -key procedures  \n• Batch card  systems including appropriate logging and alerting mechanisms  \n• Surveillance systems including alarms and, as appropriate, CCTV monitoring  \n• Receptionists and visitor policies  \n• Locking of server racks and secured equipment rooms within data centres  \n3. VIRTUAL ACC ESS CONTROL  \nFCM  implements appropriate measures to prevent its systems from being used by unauthorised persons. \nThis is accomplished by:  \n• Individual, identifiable and role -based user account assignment , role-based and password protected \naccess and authorisa tion procedures  \n• Centralised, standardised password management and password policies (minimum \nlength/characters, change of passwords)  \n• User accounts are disabled after excessive failed log -on attempts  \n• Automatic log -off in case of inactivity  \n• Anti-virus man agement  \n4. DATA ACCESS CONTROL  \nIndividuals that are granted use of FCM  systems are only able to access the data that are required to be \naccessed by them within the scope of their responsibilities and to the extent covered by their respective \naccess permission (authorisation) and such data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without \nspecific authorisation. This is accomplished by:  \n• Authentication at operating system level  \n• Separate authentication at application level  \n• Authentication against centrally managed authentication system  \n• Change control procedures that govern the handling of changes (application or OS) within the \nenvironment  \n• Remote access has appropriate authorisation and authentication  \n• Logging of system and network activities to produce an audit -trail in the event of system misuse  \n• Implementation of appropriate protection measures for stored data commensurate to risk, including \nencryption, pseudonymisation and password controls.  \n5. DISCLOSUR E CONTROL  \nFCM  implements appropriate measures to prevent data from being read, copied, altered or deleted by \nunauthorised persons during electronic transmission and during the transport of data storage media. FCM  7 \n \nC2 - Inter nal Natixis  also implements appropriate measures to ver ify to which entities’ data are transferred. This is \naccomplished by:  \n• Data transfer protocols including encryption for data carrier/media  \n• Profile set -up data transfer via secure file transfer methods  \n• Encrypted VPN  \n• No physical transfers of backup media  \n6. DATA  ENTRY CONTROL  \nFCM  implements appropriate measures to monitor whether data have been entered, changed or removed \n(deleted), and by whom. This is accomplished by:  \n• Documentation of administration activities (user account setup, change management, access and \nauthorisation procedures)  \n• Archiving of password -reset and access requests  \n• System log -files enabled by default  \n• Storage of audit logs for audit trail analysis  \n7. INSTRUCTIONAL CONTROL  \nFCM  implements appropriate measures to ensure that data may only be Processed in accordance with \nrelevant instructions. Those measures include:  \n• Binding policies and procedures on FCM  employees  \n• Where Processors are engaged in the Processing of data, including appropriate contractual \nprovisions to the agreements with Processors to maintain instructional control rights  \n8. AVAILABILITY CONTROL  \nFCM  maintains appropriate levels of redundancy and fault tolerance for accidental destruction or loss of \ndata, including:  \n• Extensive and comprehensive backup and recovery management systems  \n• Documented disaster recovery and business continuity plans and systems  \n• Storage and archive policies  \n• Anti-virus, anti -spam and firewall systems and management including policies  \n• Data centres are appropriately equipped according to risk, including physically separated back up \ndata centres, uninterruptible power supplies (including backup generators), fail redundant \nhardware and network systems and alarm and security systems (smoke, fire, water)  \n• Appropriate redundant technology on data storage systems  \n• All critical systems have backup and redundancy built into the environment.  \n9. SEPARATION CONTROL  \nFCM  impleme nts appropriate measures to ensure that data that are intended for different purposes are \nProcessed separately. This is accomplished by:  \n• Access request and authorisation processes provide logical data separation  \n• Separation of functions (production / testi ng) \n• Segregation of duties and authorisations between users, administrators and  system developers.
